## [Basic Git Guides](#git-basic-guides)

* Repository initialization and configuration.

```bash
# initialize the repo.
git init

# add the remote origin of the repo.
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# verify remote origin.
git remote -v
# output -> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# output -> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```

* Set-up email and user name.

 ```bash
git config user.email "juan_dela_cruz@example.com"
git config user.name "Juan Dela Cruz"
```

* Check status of all files in the repository

```bash
git status
```

* Adding untracked files or delete files.

```bash
# add a file to track.
git add file_name.any

# add all files within the current directory
git add .

# add all files.
git add -A
```

* Commiting and pushing changes and added files.

```bash
# commit all changes.

git commit -m "My commit message"

# push to a branch. In the exampale the branch is master it could be any branch.
git push origin master
```

* Pulling and merging changes from a branch.

```bash
# pull any updates from a branch.
git pull origin master

# In the case of unrelated histories add --allow-unrelated-histories
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

# all changes will be merged and will notify for merge conflicts. 
# if there are conflicts then resolve them manually.
# commit and push the changes to a branch.
git push origin master
```

* Cloning a repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# example
git clone https://github.com/arielmagbanua/android-mobile-app-dev-examples.git
```

## [Git Branching Guides](#git-branching-guides)

* Creating and checkout from the branch.

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

* Checkout a branch.

```bash
git checkout branch_name
```

* Merging updates from other branches.

```bash
# merge changes from example_branch_name_1
git merge example_branch_name_1

# in case of unrelated histories add --allow-unrelated-histories
git merge example_branch_name_1 --allow-unrelated-histories

# after merging if there are merge conflicts manually resolved them.
# commit the branch.
```

* Delete a local branch

```bash
# The -d option stands for --delete, which would delete the local branch, only if you have already pushed and merged it with your remote branches.
git branch -d branch_name

# The -D option stands for --delete --force, which deletes the branch regardless of its push and merge status, so be careful using this one!
git branch -D branch_name
```

* Delete a remote branch

```bash
# git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>
# git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
git push origin --delete remote_branch_name
```

## [Git Collaboration Guides](#git-collaboration-guides)

* By default your public repository can be cloned by anyone but only added collaborators can commit to any branch.

* In Github you can add collaborators to be able to contribute and commit to repositories.

* Outsiders can fork and make pull request to the owner of the repository in order to integrate their changes.

* GitHub Flow - https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
